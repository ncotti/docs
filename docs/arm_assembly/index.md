# ARM Assembly

In this section an overview of the ARM Cortex architecture and the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) will be provided.

First, the tools required to compile and analyze assembly files are explained in the [Binutils](binutils.md) section.

Then, the assembly [directives](directives.md), [instructions](instructions.md) and [interruptions](interruptions.md) are explained, and how to combine assembler and C instructions with the [ABI](abi.md).

Also, more advanced topics such as [SIMD](simd.md) and [pagination](pagination.md) are explained.
